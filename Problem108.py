Diophantine reciprocals I Problem 108
In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.

What is the least value of n for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds one-thousand?

d(m) = products of pi ^ si from i = 1 to r
number of divisors comes from the exponents of the prime factorization

Answer is n = 180180 [2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 11, 11, 13, 13]
result 32464832400 has >2,000 divisors
